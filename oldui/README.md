# Home Management Application

This application is designed to manage all the IoT devices in my house, including lights, TV, and audio equipment. 

## Technologies Used

This project uses Express and Socket.io for the backend and Vite-Vue-Vuetify for the front end. It is a redisign of my earlier project [wemo-interface](https://github.com/Xyven1/wemo-interface) updated to use vite, and refactored so that mutiple different interfaces can be created and navigated.
